        <p class="introduction">
          The Hour of Code event is one of the most popular projects in the term
          of educating young students about principles of programing. Therefore,
          <span style="color: crimson">“We Care”</span> team decided to join
          this helpful event. Our goal in the event is to inform and motivate
          young students for programming. For this, we have prepared
          presentation and simple game for those students who are going to join
          us in this event. The game will cover the tasks of “code.org” course.
          Code.org is interactive platform, which provides varieties of courses
          for students and anyone who wants to learn codding. This web-based
          platform is a great source of high-quality knowledge. We as the
          students of SITE were provided with the great opportunity of
          participating in the event called Hour of Code. In this way, we take
          aim at demonstrating students that programing may be learnt by
          everyone who are interested in this great field.

          As our team is called <span style="color: crimson">“We Care”</span>,
          we did our best to provide students with the decent knowledge.

              Finding the school for our project was the most time-consuming
              step. We made several attempts to find the school, which will
              agree on our terms. Unfortunately, many of them were unsuccessful,
              as many schools require a special permission from the authority.
              Coming back to the name of our team “We Care”, we never gave up
              and finally succeeded in our aim.

              We organized several online sessions, where we had interactive and
              interesting discussions about the content that our presentation
              will contain. The next step was, designing our presentation that
              included searching for the pictures that best described the main
              plot of the content. Moreover, we chose suitable template to
              better attract student’s attention while presenting.
