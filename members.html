            Hello! Here is some brief information about me. My full name is
            Farhan Hasanli, and I am 17 years old. I am a freshman at ADA
            University and my major is Information Technology. Since childhood,
            I decided to myself that I want to connect my future life with
            computers and deeply explore it. Another reason that also motivated
            me a lot was my uncle who was working in this field and had much
            experience which he began sharing with me. When I was in 9th grade,
            I started the courses called “Step It” and the time that I spend
            there convinced me even more of the correctness of my choice. Today,
            I had many goals that I want to achieve in this field and
            simultaneously be useful to my motherland in future.

            ADA university. I study in School of Information Systems and
            Engineering (SITE) with my major in Computer Science. All
            innovations in modern world are connected to the technologies,
            gradually all spheres are getting digitalized. Therefore, knowing
            computer and how it works is essential for everyone. When I was
            researching, on the topic of Computer Science I immediately felt
            like this technological field is the one, I want to connect my
            future life and career with. For now, I have completed half of the
            first semester and I am so happy with my choice. I acquire a lot of
            knowledge during the classes and studying process is very
            interesting.

            My name is Sadig Mammadov, and I study at ADA University as a “SITE
            student.” My major is CS (Computer Science), and I am trying to do
            my best to be a great programmer. I chose this field because I
            believe that the future is fully related to this major. In this
            regard, it may be said that the development of my homeland depends
            on this field and the technologies we will reach. I hope I will keep
            my pleasant thoughts about my choice till the end as now I do.
