We were assigned to create a website for our team, using Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript (JS). To create a proper web page by implementing all the requirements, each member successfully completed three courses from HTML, CSS and JS. Courses were provided on a web-based platform called code academy. To pass the course we were following the steps provided on the platform and coherently completing the tasks. Website project made us go beyond our boundaries and acquire new and very useful knowledge. Moreover, we did not simply get the knowledge we also implemented it. Our website contains all the detailed information about our team, team-members, our different project (Hour of Code) and the whole process of preparations for it.
